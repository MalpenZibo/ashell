# ðŸ§© Modules

Ashell modules identifies the various features of the status bar.

Each modules provide a set of functionality that can be enabled
or disabled in the configuration file.

## Organize modules

The status bar is divided into three main sections: left, center, and right.

Each section holds a list of modules or module groups,
allowing flexible layout configuration.

Modules can be used on their own or organized into groups.

### Default configuration

```toml
[modules]
left = [ "Workspaces" ]
center = [ "WindowTitle" ]
right = [ [ "Clock", "Privacy", "Settings" ] ]
```

### Example

If we want to add the `SystemInfo` module in the right side of
the status bar but not in the same group as the `Clock`, `Privacy`,
and `Settings` modules, we can do it like this:

```toml
right = [ "SystemInfo", [ "Clock", "Privacy", "Settings" ] ]
```
