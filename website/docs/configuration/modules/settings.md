This module provides access to system settings like audio, network, bluetooth,  
battery, power profile and idle inhibitor.

It displays in the status bar indicator about:

- Audio volume

- Power profile
- Idle inhibitor status

And let you interact with these settings:

- Change audio and microphone volume
- Change audio output and input devices
- Toggle network connection
- Toggle VPN connection
- Toggle airplane mode
- Change brightness
- Toggle bluetooth
- Change power profile
- Toggle idle inhibitor
- Lock the screen
- Suspend, logout, reboot, or shutdown the system

You can configure some function of this module.

With the `lock_cmd` option you can set a command to lock  
the system, if not set the related button will not appear.

With the `audio_sinks_more_cmd` and `audio_sources_more_cmd`  
options you can set commands to open the audio settings  
for sinks and sources, if not set the related buttons will not appear.

With the `network_more_cmd`, `vpn_more_cmd` and `bluetooth_more_cmd` options  
you can set commands to open the network, VPN and bluetooth settings.

With the `remove_airplane_btn` option you can remove the airplane mode button.

## Example

In the following example we use:

- `hyprlock` to lock the screen
- `pavucontrol` to open the audio settings for sinks and sources  
  directly in the correct tab.
- `nm-connection-editor` to open the network and VPN settings
- `blueman-manager` to open the bluetooth settings

We also disable the airplane mode button.

```toml
[settings]
lock_cmd = "hyprlock &"
audio_sinks_more_cmd = "pavucontrol -t 3"
audio_sources_more_cmd = "pavucontrol -t 4"
wifi_more_cmd = "nm-connection-editor"
vpn_more_cmd = "nm-connection-editor"
bluetooth_more_cmd = "blueman-manager"
remove_airplane_btn = true
```
