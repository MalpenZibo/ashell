### WARNING BREAKING CHANGES

The configuration switch from `yaml` to `toml` format. The configuration file must be updated to adapt to the new format.
The `camelCase` format has been removed in favor of `snake_case`, which better aligns with the `toml` syntax.

You could use an online tool like: https://transform.tools/yaml-to-toml but remember to change the `camelCase` to `snake_case` format.

Now the configuration file is located in `~/.config/ashell/config.toml`
