# Privacy

This module provides a way to show if the microphone,
the webcam or the screen-sharing is currently in use.

The indicators appear in red when active. Multiple indicators can be shown at once if different privacy features are in use simultaneously. The module only appears when at least one privacy feature is in use.

There are no additional configurations available for this module.
