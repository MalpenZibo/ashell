# ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration options are stored in the `config.toml` file, located at:

```
~/.config/ashell
```

:::info

Ashell does **not** create this file automatically.

:::

Ashell watches this file for changes and will apply updates immediately—so you can tweak the configuration while Ashell is running.
