# ðŸš€ Getting Started

Ashell is a status bar for Hyprland written in Rust using the iced library.

## Does it only work on Hyprland?

While it's currently tailored for Hyprland, it could work with other compositors.

However, it currently relies on [hyprland-rs](https://github.com/hyprland-community/hyprland-rs)
to gather information about the active window and workspaces.
I haven't implemented any feature flags to disable these
functionalities or alternative methods to obtain this data.
