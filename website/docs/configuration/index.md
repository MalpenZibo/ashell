# ⚙️ Configuration

All the configuration options are stored in the `config.toml` file located under `~/.config/ashell`.

> **Note** Ashell will not create this file automatically.

Ashell will watch changes on this file and apply them immediately, so you can change the configuration while Ashell is running.

See more on the toml format [here](https://toml.io/en/).
