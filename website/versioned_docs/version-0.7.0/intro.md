# 🚀 Getting Started

Ashell is a status bar for Hyprland and Niri, written in Rust using the `iced` library.

## Does it only work on Hyprland and Niri?

This project originally supported only Hyprland, primarily because
it is the compositor I use to test ashell.

Thanks to community support, ashell now supports Niri as well.

In the future, we plan to expand this functionality to other
Wayland compositors.
