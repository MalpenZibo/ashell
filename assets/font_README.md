# Icons Font

ashell uses a subset of [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
and some custom icons for its terminal UI.

The Nerd Fonts subset is created during the build process.

This custom font is created from the svg files present in this folder
using [GlyphrStudio](https://www.glyphrstudio.com/app/) and it's
project file `ashell_custom_icon_project.gs2`.

## Custom Icons creation

I'm not an expert in font creation.
Right now I created svg icons using the svg resources in `raw_custom_icons_resources.svg`
using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) with icons for peripherals devices like keyboard,
mouse, headset, etc. that combines the peripheral icon with the battery icon.

To produce the final otf file i used [GlyphrStudio](https://www.glyphrstudio.com/app/).
The project file is `ashell_custom_icon_project.gs2`.
