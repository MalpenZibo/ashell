# ⚙️ Configuration

All the configuration options are stored in the `config.toml`
file located under `~/.config/ashell`.

:::info

Ashell will not create this file automatically.

:::

Ashell will watch changes on this file and apply them immediately,
so you can change the configuration while Ashell is running.

See more on the [toml format](https://toml.io/en/).
